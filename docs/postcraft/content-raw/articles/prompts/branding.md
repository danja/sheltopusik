I would like you to create an image. But first please read this whole description and think about it before creating a description that captures all these elements in a way that Dall-e will understand and know how to create accurately. We require a brand image for a new lisp-like esoteric language called sheltopusik.  It should be square with a border that makes it look slightly embossed. Inside that, the main picture with be between square brackets, [ ]. It should superficially look like a marketing image or logo for a modern software company. But the main image will be a parody of media portrayals views of hackers. This will be a photorealistic image of a sheltopusik snake-like lizard with a yellow belly working at a linux terminal with berserk-looking green-on-black text on the screen. He is surrounded by broken computers.  This is inside a dark leafy wood with lots of dangling vines which around him change into a tangle of cables. The sheltopusik itself has big bloodshot eyes and looks startled and confused. Beneath this image is the title "Sheltopusic" in an exaggerated 3D monotype terminal font.
